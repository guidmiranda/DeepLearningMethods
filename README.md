# DeepLearningMethods

The goal of this project is to predict whether a client will deposit or withdraw funds from their portfolio–a binary classification problem.The target variableconsidered forthis projectwas based onthe column “Net Amount” which represents the difference between the total amount of deposits and withdrawals.By predicting these outcomes, it is possible, for the investment companyto tailor theircustomer  retention strategy, accordingto  each  client’s  probability  of  churnand  to possibly avoid the clients’ withdrawal movements from the company’s account.Also,even if the outcome of the model is positive –this is, the client is predicted not to withdrawmoney –the  company  can  act  in order  to persuade  the  client  to  increase  their  wallet share.
